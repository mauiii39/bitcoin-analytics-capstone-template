    "## Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy & Prediction Market Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "#### Key Findings (Non-Trivial & Actionable)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bitcoin daily returns are approximately serially uncorrelated, confirming weak-form efficiency at the daily horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Volatility is highly persistent and strongly clustered, with clear regime behavior across cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On-chain metrics (hash rate, active addresses, transactions, volume) are strongly correlated with price levels but show near-zero predictive power for 30-day forward returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market capitalization growth appears predictive, but this effect is mechanically driven and not economically tradable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rolling volatility exhibits meaningful lead effects on 30-day forward returns, suggesting regime-dependent accumulation timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structural blockchain metrics function primarily as coincident indicators, not forward-looking signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These results strongly motivate incorporating forward-looking probabilistic signals (Polymarket) to improve accumulation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "If short-term accumulation timing is possible, it likely requires external expectation-based signals, not internally generated on-chain metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The autocorrelation function (ACF) of log returns fluctuates near zero.\n",

    "- Bitcoin returns are difficult to predict linearly at daily frequency.\n",
    "- Volatility is persistent and regime-dependent.\n",
    "- On-chain fundamentals lack short-term directional signal.\n",
